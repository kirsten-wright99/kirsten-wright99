I am currently an embedded software engineer at L3Harris, working on testing and integration software for our imaging systems. Previously, I was an embedded software intern at MITRE, the data acquisition lead for the Society of Automotive Engineers, and lead a small team doing a robotics project with NASA. 

👀 I’m interested in space, bioinformatics, embedded systems, robotics and more!

📍 San Rafael, California
